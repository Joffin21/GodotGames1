# CuteCrashCourse

There was one interesting lesson about animations for the character that was generally different from the tutorials I had done before. However, outside of that small part, most of the rest of the tutorial was stuff I've already learned before so I didn't really follow along as much. He also made cuts in his video skipping to a point where all the code was already written.
I probably won't post the screenrecording for that right now. Maybe later.
