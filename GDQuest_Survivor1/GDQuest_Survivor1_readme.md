# FirstGame

This is the second game I've ever created. I very closely followed **GDQuest**'s Youtube tutorial (**Your First 2D GAME From Zero in Godot 4 **Vampire Survivor Style****: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwCiGixlqiU&list=PL940QZx0z8pe1tEdJdQJkRsnQrVy8HBYb&index=7). There may be some minor differences in my game and what he ultimately created, but for the most part it is the same. 

I already took some of my learnings from my first game and applied it here. Some simple examples include adding world boundaries, collapsing all the pinetrees into a single node so my game scene is more organized, etc. I didn't attempt to convert this into a phone game with touch controls. I'm going to look for a phone game tutorial specifically for my 3rd game, so hopefully will learn more there.
