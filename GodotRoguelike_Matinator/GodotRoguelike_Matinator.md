# GodotRogueLike_Matinator

This was a Godot 3 tutorial. I barely started it. It looked really interesting though, so maybe later when I understand Godot better and know how to do what he was describing without needing to follow along (because of the differencers between versions), then I'll actually continue this. 
That is the main reason, I'm choosing to keep this folder even though I barely did anything with it. So yea, no screenshots or videos
