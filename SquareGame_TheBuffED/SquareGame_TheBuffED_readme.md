# Simplifall - Square Game by TheBuffED

This game is incomplete; actually the tutorial is incomplete. I followed along for the first 5 videos, and then the 6th video seemed to be a quick recap of what the end state should be without walking you through it, so I decided to move on from that tutorial after hearing that. Tutorial in question: **TheBuffED**'s Youtube tutorial (**Godot - Mobile App Tutorial Part 1 - The Goal****: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJZlweFFLZM&list=PLvN5Z3tTxXEB6U8rXN7_s-0cXQpwkrE_P&index=1). Note the tutorial was made in Godot 3, but my code was written in Godot 4, so there are some changes. 

Main take aways from this: 
- Set up a game for mobile (Probably still need more refreshers for this though)
- Learned about tweens 
  - Pasting this following link that I found on reddit regarding tweens when doing more research. This will be helpful when trying to understand what I want to use later down the line: (https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/14gt180/all_possible_tweening_transition_types_and_easing/)
- Mini-GPT overview of Control-based Nodes (like the VBoxContainer) and then Node2D, which have a position. Could not tween the position of the VBoxContainer directly, so instead wrapped it under a parent Node2D node that does have a position. 
- Used signals a bit more with different buttons (just more practice with this since every tutorial needed this so far)
- Set up a Global script (didn't get to use it, but was cool to see an autoloaded script and where globals would be. As explained in the video, the selected color for the game would sit here)
