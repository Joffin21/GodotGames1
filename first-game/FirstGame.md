# FirstGame

This is the first game I've ever created. I very closely followed **Brackeys** Youtube tutorial (**How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0&t=2064s). There may be some minor differences in my game and what he ultimately created, but for the most part it is the same. I want to log my game development journey here, so even though this is mostly copy and paste, I want to document the work I'm doing. I will also add some screenshots and maybe a short video to reference here as well.
